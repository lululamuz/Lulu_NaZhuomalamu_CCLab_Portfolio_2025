    Project 1: Lost & Found 

   <p/>
    
    <p>
      
      Assignment 1 explores this ambiguity in human language as well as the gap between human language and computer language. 
    Completed in pairs of two, I worked with Cathy Choi and exchanged detailed descriptions of a place that was important to us in the past. 
    Then based on the description I received, I re-create an image of the place in p5.js.
  
  <p/>
  <p>
     Object description received: When you sit by the window at the restaurant Seokkeut in Dadaepo, the view stretches in two directions: 
    to the left, a low green mountain, and to the right, the wide expanse of the beach where people stroll along the sand. 
    Inside, the restaurant feels calm and cozy, with a soft atmosphere that makes you want to slow down. 
    The staff are warm and welcoming, and the signature dish—galchi sokjeot pasta—arrives looking fiery red and spicy. 
    But the first bite surprises you; instead of harsh heat, it carries a deep, savory flavor that lingers in the best way. 
    For me, it tastes even better with a cold beer, something I can enjoy freely here because I am an adult in Korea. 
    From the bar table by the window, I often watch the sun set over the water. The sky turns orange, then crimson, and the waves catch the last light of the day. 
    In those moments, with good food, good drink, and that quiet view, it feels impossible not to fall in love with this place.
  <p/>
    <p>
     My interpretation of the image: A restaurant in Korea that is near to the ocean, with a comfortable interior design. 
    The large window next to the table reveals a beautiful scenery of mountain, beach, sea and sunset. 
    My partner Cathy enjoyed the beer with the accompany of the signature dish galchi sokjeot pasta. 
    In general, it is a place that serves breath taking food with a scenery that is unforgettable. 
<p/>
  <p>
    Initially, from what I imagined and expected, I drew the sketch of this place in my mind then on a piece of paper. 
    Then, I recreated this image using code according to the sketch that I drew earlier. 
    Some minor aspects of the sketch couldn't be completed, however, the general outcome is satisfying.
