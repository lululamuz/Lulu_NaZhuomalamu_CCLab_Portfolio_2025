      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>
        I started studying abroad in 8th grade, and went to Zug Switzerland,
        London UK, and New York US. I studied IGCSE, A-Level, and now study
        Art at Parsons School of Design, majoring in Design & Technology.
      </p>

      <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
      <p>
        Drawing, painting, snowboarding, horse riding, watching movies,
        reading, directing creative vids, hanging out with friends...etc.
      </p>

      <h2>Career Goals</h2>
      <p>
        A job that offers a lot of flexibility, lets me explore innovative
        ideas, and allows for teamwork.
      </p>

      <h2>Reflections on Technology & Coding</h2>
      <p>
        I see technology as an inevitable force shaping the future. Through
        the combined efforts of designers and scientists, it transforms
        everyday life, making it more seamless and accessible. Coding forms
        one of the core foundations of this transformation. As a designer,
        I hope to generate innovative ideas that can evolve into meaningful,
        practical solutions in the near future.
