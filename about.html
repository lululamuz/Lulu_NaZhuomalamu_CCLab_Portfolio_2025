  I see technology as an inevitable force shaping the future. 
    Through the combined efforts of designers and scientists, it transforms everyday life, making it more seamless and accessible. 
    Coding forms one of the core foundations of this transformation.
    As a designer, I hope to generate innovative ideas that can evolve into meaningful, practical solutions in the near future.
