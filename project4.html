  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>

   Exquisite corpse is a surrealist technique where players take turns to draw a portion of a figure while not being able to see what has already been drawn by other players. 
  The drawing gets revealed at the end, which tends to create surprising and unexpected forms and narratives. For this image, the head portion is my original design, while the body and the bottom portion are from classmates.
